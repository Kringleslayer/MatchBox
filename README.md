# MatchBox

MatchBox is a Processing-based matchmaking application designed to calculate the compatibility between two people based on various attributes.

## Overview

This project uses a GUI (Graphical User Interface) built with the G4P library to collect data for two individuals. It analyzes their names, ages, physical attributes, interests, and zodiac signs to generate a "compatibility score." The closer the scores, the better the match!

## Features

- **Interactive GUI:** Easy-to-use forms for entering user data.
- **Zodiac Selection:** Dedicated selector for choosing zodiac signs.
- **Validation:** Ensures all necessary fields are filled before calculating.
- **Complex Scoring Algorithm:** Points are awarded based on:
  - Name length
  - Age (Adult status)
  - Height and Weight categories
  - Number of interests
  - Zodiac element (Fire, Water, Air, Earth)
- **Compatibility Verdicts:** Provides fun, text-based feedback on the relationship potential (e.g., "Perfect match", "Total mismatch").

## Requirements

- **Processing IDE:** Download from [processing.org](https://processing.org/).
- **G4P Library:** This project requires the G4P library for the GUI.
  - Install via the Processing IDE: *Sketch* -> *Import Library...* -> *Add Library...* -> Search for "G4P".

## How to Run

1. Open `MatchBox.pde` in the Processing IDE.
2. Ensure the G4P library is installed.
3. Click the **Run** button.
4. Click **Start** on the main menu.
5. Fill in the details for Person 1 and Person 2.
6. Click **Confirm** to see the compatibility verdict in the console.

## Project Structure

- **MatchBox.pde:** Main entry point of the application.
- **gui.pde:** Handles the GUI layout, window creation, and event listeners (generated by G4P).
- **Person.pde:** Defines the `Person` class and the logic for calculating individual scores.
- **helperFunctions.pde:** Contains utility functions for validation (`catchErrors`), data extraction (`getValues`), and the core compatibility logic (`identifyProblems`).
